##3.4	Proposed Project works and anticipated Activities
Below is a description of the proposed works and the anticipated activities.
The proposed LISP livestock infrastructure is in seven (7) categories namely: Livestock Service Centres Tier 1, Livestock Service Centres Tier 1+, Livestock Service Centres Tier 2, Milk Collection Centres (MCC), Livestock Market Centres (LMC), Livestock Slaughter Facilities (LSF), and Laboratories. Out of these, only Livestock Service Centres Tier 1 will be demand driven. The other forms of infrastructure are discussed below.

##5.	DESCRIPTION OF THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT
 + change the map here, plus maybe some other info
 + remove/replace some images on page 5-5 and edit the context
 + 5.5.3	Population: change the highlighted data in table

##5.3.1.5	Wind
```
highlighted part begin:

The windiest months are August and September and the least windy months are January and February. Wind speeds range from a low of 1.1m/s to a high of 2.2m/s (ibid.).

##5.5.9	Tourism/Recreation

```
highlighted part begin:

The prominent tourism facility in the project area is the Chishimba Falls in Kasama, Mwela Paintings in Kasama, Kalambo Falls and Motomoto Museum in Mbala, Nachikufu Caves in Mpika. Tourism industry has not yet fully developed in district. These sites are however far away from the project sites.

##6.	ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
6.1	Introduction	

`check the **strong** text here (it is highlighted in actual doc)`

This section presents the environmental and social impacts expected from the livestock infrastructure project.  The impacts are grouped into two major categories with respect to the period in the project’s life cycle when they are expected to occur. These are the construction and operation phases. In each of these categories, the impacts are grouped according to whether they are negative or positive. They are further classified according to the environs upon which they are impacting. These are the physical, biological or socio-economic environments. At the end of the section, all the impacts discussed are summarised in **Tables 6.1 and 6.2**. The definitions of the terms used in the Tables are explained in **Table D1 in Appendix D**. 


##6.2.1.3 iv)	Loss of livelihoods for squatters
```
highlighted part begin:

Over time, communities have settled in some of these Livestock Areas such as at Kalungwishi Ranch (Figure 6.2). The Consultant was informed that land some piece of land was has been set aside where the squatters will be relocated.

v)	Danger of people and traffic falling into excavated trenches
Trenches for foundation of various infrastructures have the potential of increasing accidents; either pedestrians or traffic can fall into them. The magnitude of the **significance** of this impact will depend on the location of the site. As the project sites are in small restricted areas which largely sparsely inhabited, this impact will be low and short term. 


##6.3	Operation phase

```
highlighted part begin:

All impacts envisaged in the operation phase on all the environs of interest are presented in this section. These include both the negative and positive impacts.

+ check item iii (Change in Water Quantity) under 6.3.1.1 (Impacts on Environment). Need to check how much water will be abstracted per day.


##6.4	Summary of Impacts : Check the data and formatting of the ensuing Tables.


##8.	ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL IMPACT MANAGEMENT PLAN
 + Intro (8.1) && Environmental Management Plan (8.2) are both highlighted
 + Check Table 8.1 a.k.a Environmetal Management Plan, (data plus formatting), there is some highlighted cells here and there
 + 8.3 Environmetal Monitoring Section highlighted

##Section 9.2 on Decommisioning and Closure Plans is highlighted

##Appendices
- Fix Appendix A
- Appendix B: Mjor ISsues Raised from COnsultattions??? remove this appendix and check doc for all references
- APPENDIX C – DRAWINGS GIVING LOCATIONS OF THE PROPOSED LIVESTOCK INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN NORTHERN AND MUCHINGA PROVINCES
	- U can add a table with GPS coordinates
- Appendix D is OKAY
