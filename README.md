Bible-Playlist-Generator
========================

This python script generates an m3u playlist of 10 Bible Chapters (represented by 10 mp3 files) to be listened to on any given day _x_, according to [**Professor Grant Horner's Bible-Reading System**](http://www.thevinefellowship.com/10Lists.pdf). The audio Bible is as downloaded from the [_Faith Comes by HearingÂ®_ website](http://www.bible.is/audiodownloader).

The script also copies the files on the playlist into a new folder
so that you can carry the folder on your USB or any other device and listen anywhere (car, home theatre, phone, tablet, etc).
